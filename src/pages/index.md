    <p>
      It is now commonplace to hear that we live in the age of finance, but for the vast majority of people in the United States and beyond, our era is experienced as the age of crushing debt. As a result of soaring education costs, unaffordable housing, bankruptcies from medical bills, usurious payday loans, and unpayable financial obligations from mass incarceration, household debt continues to spiral. Student debt alone stands at $1.6 trillion. Our students are graduating with an average of $30,000 in debt, and every year, there are 1.1 million new defaulters on those debts. Debt-financed higher education has taken a radically unequal toll on Black, Latinx and Native households because they hold just a fraction of the wealth of white households. Four years after graduating, the average loan balances of Black student debtors are more than double that of their white counterparts, due to discrepancies that can be traced to employment discrimination, racial wage gaps, and differentials in intergenerational wealth.
    </p>

    <p>
      As educators, we know that debt-financed higher education has been a profound mistake, and also a relatively recent one. (Student debt was too insignificant to track in 1999.) By slashing funding to education, federal and state lawmakers shifted the burden to students and families, especially to those least able to afford it. Activists from the Occupy Student Debt Campaign to Strike Debt to Movement for Black Lives to the Debt Collective have been sounding the alarm and organizing around this issue for the last eight years. Indeed, the Debt Collective organized the first successful student debt strike in U.S. history, winning over $1 billion in debt discharge in a campaign with for-profit college debtors. Finally, politicians are listening.
    </p>

    <p>
      In June 2019, lawmakers Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), and Bernie Sanders (D-VT) introduced the College for All act (with help from student debt strikers). The legislation would wipe out all $1.6 trillion in outstanding student debt for 45 million borrowers, eliminate tuition and fees at all public two-year and four-year colleges and universities, provide funding streams to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Tribal Colleges, and make community colleges, trade schools, and apprenticeship programs tuition-and fee-free for all. These measures will be paid for by a financial transaction tax on Wall Street of the kind currently imposed by 40 countries around the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      We see this legislation as a powerful first step in the process of reinvestment in quality public education. We know that subsequent steps will require the fight for state reinvestment, high quality and diverse curricula, robust research support, and the de-adjunctification of our workforce.
    </p>

    <p>
      Research from the Levy Institute and the Roosevelt Institute shows that a full jubilee—an erasure of all student loans currently on the books—would not only be a substantial boost to GDP but also a significant narrowing of the racial wealth gap, and therefore a means to begin addressing the need for reparations in and through higher education. Far from a boon to the already-wealthy, the vast majority of the benefits of universal debt discharge would go to the bottom 20% of households. The largest impact, in proportion to household wealth, would be on Black and Latinx families and communities, and women in those communities in particular, who hold the disproportionate share of the debt load. In addition, a significant percentage of student debtors were defrauded by for-profit colleges (which intentionally target and exploit marginalized communities) and these students routinely carry high debt burdens, often without ever having graduated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than distinguish between “worthy” and “unworthy” debtors, or create a pecking order of who deserves more, less, or no relief, we applaud the fact that College for All is being proposed in the lineage of universal programs like Social Security and Medicare. While there are other policy options on the table, we strongly believe that universal programs are engines of popular solidarity that draw their power from uniting the most people under a single demand: education should be a right, not a privilege. A demand for universal student debt relief, alongside the proposal for tuition-free public college, unites tens of millions of people around a commonly shared idea. College for All, like Medicare for All, is a meaningful step toward de-financializing our basic social needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      In other industrialized countries, higher education, like healthcare, is regarded as a public good and as a right, but in the U.S., it has been turned into an expensive commodity. Now is the time to reclaim the vocation of learning to which we have devoted our careers. College for All is the first serious step toward that goal we have seen in our lifetime.
    </p>

    <p>
      We, the undersigned, stand in firm support of this bill and express our commitment to fight for its passage into law.

    </p>

    <p>
      We pledge to form, or support, faculty-student pressure groups on our own campuses to actively promote the agenda of College for All, without regard to the outcome of the bill itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      We pledge to actively support efforts by national political, educational or labor groups willing to fight for the agenda of College for All.
